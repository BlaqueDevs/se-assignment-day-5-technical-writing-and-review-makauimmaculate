✔ H4-H6 (Deeper levels if needed) – Use sparingly for more complex topics

📌 Example:

H1: The Basics of Cybersecurity
    H2: Common Cyber Threats
        H3: Phishing Attacks
        H3: Malware and Ransomware
    H2: How to Protect Your Data

2. Keep Headings Concise & Descriptive
✔ Avoid vague headings like "Introduction" or "More Info"
✔ Use specific wording to tell the reader exactly what to expect

📌 Bad Example: "System Info"
📌 Good Example: "System Requirements for Installation"

3. Make Headings Skimmable
✔ Use keywords relevant to your content
✔ Keep them short (ideally under 10 words)
✔ Ensure they stand out (bold, larger font, or different color)

📌 Example: Instead of "How to Use the New Features in Version 2.0 of Our Software," try:
✅ "Using New Features in Software v2.0"

4. Use Parallel Structure
✔ Keep a consistent format (e.g., all headings as statements or questions)
✔ Avoid mixing different styles within the same level

📌 Bad Example:

What is Cloud Computing?
The Benefits of Using It
Challenges Faced by Businesses
📌 Good Example:

What is Cloud Computing?
What Are the Benefits of Cloud Computing?
What Challenges Does Cloud Computing Present?
5. Avoid Excessive Capitalization or Punctuation
✔ Use Title Case (capitalize main words) or Sentence case (capitalize only the first word)
✔ Avoid ALL CAPS (harder to read)
✔ Limit punctuation—headings don’t need periods

📌 Bad Example:
🚫 "WHY YOU SHOULD USE DATA ENCRYPTION!!!"
📌 Good Example:
✅ "Why You Should Use Data Encryption"

6. Use Action-Oriented & Engaging Wording
✔ When possible, make headings actionable ("How to Secure Your Network" vs. "Network Security")
✔ Ask questions to spark curiosity ("What Makes a Website Secure?")

📌 Example:

Boring: "Cloud Backup Options"
Engaging: "How to Choose the Best Cloud Backup Service"
7. Optimize for SEO & Accessibility
✔ Include important keywords naturally
✔ Use descriptive alt text for screen readers (if headings include images/icons)
✔ Follow a logical flow to make navigation easy

📌 Example: Instead of "Software Features," use "Top Features of Our Project Management Software"

8. Avoid Overuse of Headings
✔ Too many subheadings break the flow of reading
✔ Use headings only when necessary to create meaningful structure

📌 Bad Example:
🚫 H1: Website Security
🚫 H2: Why It's Important
🚫 H3: The Reasons Why Security Matters
🚫 H4: Explanation of Security Issues

📌 Good Example:
✅ H1: Website Security
    ✅ H2: Why Website Security Matters
    ✅ H2: Common Website Security Threats

9. Ensure Headings Match Content
✔ A heading should accurately reflect the section's content
✔ Avoid clickbait-style headings that mislead the reader

📌 Bad Example: "The Ultimate Guide to Speed Up Your PC" (but the section only covers one method)
📌 Good Example: "5 Quick Ways to Speed Up Your PC"

10. Use Formatting Consistently
✔ Stick to one font size and style per heading level
✔ Use bold or larger text instead of just color for emphasis (color alone isn’t accessible to all users)
✔ If using numbers, keep them consistent (e.g., all numbered or none)

📌 Example:

Consistent:

1. Getting Started
2. Installation Guide
3. Troubleshooting
Inconsistent:

Step 1: Getting Started
Install the Software
Troubleshooting Tips
